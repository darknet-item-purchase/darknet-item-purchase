## Understanding Darknet Markets: A Primer

Darknet markets offer platforms for anonymous transactions, enabling buyers and sellers to exchange goods and services in a secure, private environment. Accessed primarily through the Tor network, these markets use multiple layers of encryption to maintain anonymity.  Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Monero (XMR) are the main payment methods.

*   **Onion Links & Mirror Sites:** Secure access is granted through onion links and mirror sites, which provide uninterrupted access.
*   **Escrow Systems:** Funds are held securely until the buyer confirms product receipt, minimizing fraud.
*   **PGP & 2FA:** PGP encryption and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) are implemented to secure communications and accounts.

##  Getting Started: Registering on a Darknet Market

Account creation is the initial step to begin buying. The process is generally consistent across most platforms, with minor variations.

###  Essential Registration Steps for Safety:

1.  **Access:** Use Tor Browser to access the correct onion URL or a verified mirror link.
